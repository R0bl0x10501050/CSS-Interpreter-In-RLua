## Intro

Hey Developers!

This is a little interpreter I wrote in Lua for CSS to help further simplify the process of styling GUIs with code. For those of you with prior coding experience in the web, you must know of the styling language CSS.

### Examples of CSS:
```css
body {
  background-color: #000000;
  color: #ffffff;
}
```

I made my CSS Interpreter to model exactly after the actual one.

### My CSS:
```css
body {
  background-color: #000000;
  color: #ffffff;
}
```

It's the same!
